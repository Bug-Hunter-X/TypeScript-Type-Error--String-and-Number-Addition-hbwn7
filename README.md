# TypeScript Type Error: String and Number Addition

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when attempting to add a string and a number.  The TypeScript compiler correctly flags this as an error, but the error message may not be immediately clear to all users. 

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version.  The solution involves explicit type checking or type conversion to resolve the type mismatch.
